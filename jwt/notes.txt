To handle authentication securely with JWTs, the common practice is as follows:

1  During the initial login process, the user provides their username and password.

2 The server verifies the username and password, and if they are correct, it generates a JWT containing claims about the user (e.g., user ID, roles).

3 The JWT is sent to the client, typically stored securely, and included in the headers of subsequent requests for authentication.
